Archimedes' principle

Wikipedia quote
"Archimedes' principle states that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid,
whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body's displaces and acts in the upward
direction at the center of mass of the displaced fluid. Archimedes' principle is a law of physics fundamental to fluid mechanics.
It was formulated by Archimedes of Syracuse."
